high priority
=============
cancellation race concerns - better tracking of kernel feedback?

for 1.0
=======
API docs
isochronous endpoint I/O
thread safety
abstraction for cross-platform-ness

for 1.1 or future
==================
optional timerfd support (runtime detection)
notifications of hotplugged/unplugged devices
use poll() rather than select()?

1.0 API style/naming points to reconsider
=========================================

struct libusb_(bulk|control)_transfer or parameters?
devh in general
urbh in general (should this be a transfer handle?)
find/get devices API
config struct/function naming
