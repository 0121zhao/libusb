isochronous endpoint I/O
optional timerfd support (runtime detection)
API docs
notifications of hotplugged/unplugged devices
thread safety
use poll() rather than select()?
abstraction for cross-platform-ness

=====================================

struct libusb_(bulk|control)_transfer or parameters?
devh in general
urbh in general (should this be a transfer handle?)
find/get devices API
config struct/function naming
