for 1.0
=======
cancellation race concerns - better tracking of kernel feedback?
API docs
isochronous endpoint I/O
thread safety
abstraction for cross-platform-ness
error codes
fixme review

add some libusb_transfer flags:
 - treat short transfers as errors
 - unlink behaviour control
 - setup packet prepends data (no copying needed)
 - update timeout with time remaining

1.0 API style/naming points to reconsider
=========================================
devh in general
config struct/function naming
typedef _cb or _cb_fn or _cb_t?
typedef as-is or pointers? libusb_dev_t rather than libusb_dev *?

for 1.1 or future
==================
optional timerfd support (runtime detection)
notifications of hotplugged/unplugged devices
use poll() rather than select()?
